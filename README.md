PCEC - Minimum Path-Collection Exact Cover:

Given a Graph $G$ and a set $S$ of paths in $G$, find a minimum subset of paths in $S$ such that every edge is contained in exactly one path. This problem is NP-hard and we solved it with a Branch and Bound algorithm.

Working on right now:

* Fixing the basic Dancing links algorithm
* Hashing to avoid overcounting
* Bounds
* Order of processing
* Automated tests
