# Test Case Generator and Analysis Tool

## Overview

This folder contains cpp files that are used to generate different types of graphs and paths in these graphs. We also have python scripts that can automatically generate new instances/graphs and test the code on these instances. Additionally, there are also some pre generated graphs and instances.

## Test Cases format

The first line contains three integers: n (number of vertices), m (number of edges), p (number of paths). The next m lines describe the edges in the format a b (edge connecting vertex a and b). The next 2p lines describe the paths, the first line contains the size of the path and the second line contains the sequence of vertices. Every graph is 1-indexed, which means the vertices are labelled from 1 to n.
